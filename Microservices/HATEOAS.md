HATEOAS, which stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST architectural style that emphasizes the use of hypermedia links within the responses of a RESTful API. This approach allows clients to dynamically navigate the API by following links provided in the responses, without requiring prior knowledge of the API's structure or endpoints. For example, when a client retrieves data from an API, the response not only includes the requested information but also links to related actions or resources, such as editing, deleting, or accessing further details. This enhances the discoverability and self-descriptiveness of the API, making it easier to maintain and evolve over time. By adhering to HATEOAS, APIs promote loose coupling between client and server, as clients rely on the hypermedia links to guide their interactions rather than hardcoding endpoint paths.
