## Rigid Systems
Rigid systems oppose change, to change one module you require changes in a lot of modules. Work in rigid systems cannot be correctly estimated.

## Fragile Systems
One change in fragile systems affects a lot of related/unrelated modules in unexpected ways.

## Inseparable Systems
When components of one system cannot be used anywhere outside often due to carrying a lot of unnecessary things for the reusability to happen. 

## Opaque System
Ineptly structured systems that no amount of effort spent on reading the code clarifies the intent of the author.
