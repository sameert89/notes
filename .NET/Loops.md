There are four types of loops available in `.NET`. All of them support **break** and **continue**.

## Do-While Loop

Bog Standard do while loop
```csharp
do
{
	// Something
} while (x); // <- this is true
```

## While Loop

Bog Standard while loop-

```csharp
while (x)
{
	// do something while x is true
}
```

## for loop

For loops are available and work as expected-

```csharp
for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
	// Do something
}
```

## foreach loop
