Composed of the following: 
- **CLI Tools**
- **Roslyn**: C# and VB compiler
- **CoreFX**: set of frameworks and libraries.
- **CoreCLR**: A JIT based Command Language runtime. It executes the .NET applications, has features like GC, JIT, Exception Handling etc. It is essentially the runtime environment for .NET applications.

*Why the need of a separate Runtime?*
Unlike C++ and Java, .NET applications are not directly compiled to machine code but are compiled to **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**. It is platform agnostic.
