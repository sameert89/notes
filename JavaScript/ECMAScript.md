ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is a standardized scripting language specification that JavaScript (JS) is based on. It defines the core features and syntax for the JavaScript language. ECMAScript is not a programming language itself but rather a specification that browser vendors and JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox) implement to ensure consistency and interoperability across different platforms.

ES6 was the biggest JS Release in 2015 and started something called **Modern JavaScript.**
