*"Learning has no predetermined sequence; it's a journey where understanding unfurls with each encounter of the new."*
But here is a sequence you should follow anyways.
1. [[Graphs]]
2. [[Depth First Search (DFS)]]
3. [[Breadth First Search (BFS)]]
4. [[Topological Sort]]
5. [[Cycle Detection]]
6. [[Shortest Path Problem]]
7. [[Disjoint Set Union(DSU)]]
8. [[Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)]]
9. [[Graphs/Problems]]
