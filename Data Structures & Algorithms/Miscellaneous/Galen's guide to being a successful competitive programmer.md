_**"No roadmap will work if you are not practicing problems the right way that is practicing to learn..."**_

# General 
##  The Learning Mindset

- I am practicing to get better at solving.
- In editorials try to find out how to come up with this solutions.
- Try to spend as much time on a problem as you can.
- Think of things that you aren't already familiar with.
- Spend time thinking about problems, don't let your ðŸ§  sit idle.
- Ask why more and more, why is this & why is that.

- ### How to practice
	It is easy to lie to yourself that you are "practicing" by spending time and not deeply understanding the problems.
	The best practice is the practice where you are motivated. Motivation has to be interest in the problems. Solve problems with no intentions to read the editorials. Beginners don't need to learn anything just try to come up with A,B,C solutions. Don't jump for complex algorithms for these. (skipping problems and making excuses to do it in leetcode randomizer)
	Any reasonable method that does not let you deceive yourself is a good practice method.

- If you don't like it, it's going to be harder. 
- Comparisons are not good, compare yourself to you 1 year earlier.
- Fix your health and sleep cycle, it will help only if a little.
- Find some friends if you can. Do not become over reliant however.
- Improve skills and not rating.
- You can take breaks it is not a crime.
- Practice to build confidence.
- Upsolve!!!
- Don't guess problems try to prove the solutions.
## Mistakes

- Not learning from problems.
- Focusing too hard on speed, for long term improvement this helps a lot.
- Look for your weaknesses and work on them (topics that you suck at).
- Don't jump directly into code try to build the solution and proving it to yourself. 
- Take time to look for edge cases.
- Do not misread.
- Don't leave the problem without attempting, if its hard then that does not mean you cannot do it.

# Practice

Problems should be difficult for you. Find the problem places in Roadmap Resources. Do what is fun.
- 2-4 hours a day is enough.
- Daily problem quotas are bad.
- Short time: 20-45 minutes, Medium time: 1-4 hours both **after being stuck** get to the point where you are stuck.
- Try to look for though processes in editorials. Why your ideas did not work. You can read editorials line by line and think about each line for 10 minutes.
- Do a healthy mix of random problems and topic based problems. Focus more on random problems.
- Select random problems to solve, taking note of weaknesses. To handle a weakness, do some problems involving that weakness, then go back to random problems. If the weakness is still an issue, continue with random problems, but skewed to have more problems with that weakness.

# Rating based advice
## 0-999
- Math and basic reasoning. 
- #math #greedy #constructive #brute-force #searching #sorting #strings #number-theory 
- #binary-search #two-pointers
- Solve A and B smoothly (div 2)  and A, B, C for div 3 contests.
- Just improve reasoning, practice random problems.
- Focus on weaknesses.

## 1000-1199
- #brute-force #sorting #number-theory #strings #stl 
- #bitwise #binary-search #bitwise #dynamic_programming #combinatorics #range-queries
- Solve A, B fast and solve C and A-D for div 3 contests.

## 1200-1399
- still a lot of reasoning.
- above topics + #modular-arithmetic #gcd #prime-factors #prefix-sum #recursions #dynamic_programming #graphs #trees #bfs #dfs #dsu #segment-trees #hashing 
- Solve quickly 3 problems in div 2 for div 3 A-D or A-E.
- This is not rigid you may blow some contests.

## 1400-1599
- You have done it, you have good practice strats.
- above topics + #tree-dp #proofs #constructive #inclusion-exclusion #probability #shortest-path #MST #game-theory 
- Solve A-C consistently and quickly.

## 1600-1899
- Its just you and practice. 
- #graphs #toposort #expected-value #bitwise 
- A-D consistently in div 2 and all in div 3.

## 1900-2099
- new problems are based on reasoning. Knowing the basics is enough.
- A-B div 1 A-E div 2.
